                <p>
                    Resistance is a major barrier to cancer remission. However, it is not practical to 
                    test all the millions of potential drug combinations due to cost limitations. To help 
                    prioritize drug pairings for further evaluation, we studied the similarity of drugs 
                    grouped by mechanisms-of-action (MOA) in published drug screens. With this process, 
                    termed the Mechanism-of-action Landscape (MOAL), 131 drug MOA pairings were prioritized 
                    from more than 1.8 million potential drug pairings. Though this method does not evaluate 
                    synergy, it has been used to study more than a thousand drugs whereas other methods have 
                    only studied on the order of ten to one hundred drugs. In addition to recovering established 
                    drug combinations (e.g., MEK and RAF inhibitors in skin cancer), this method has also detected 
                    potential drug pairings which have not been well studied and demonstrated that results can vary 
                    depending on tissue type. Furthermore, we show that the MOAL method is beneficial over a simple 
                    UMAP visualization because it uses statistics to eliminate more than 96% of potential drug MOA 
                    pairings from consideration and identifies significant MOA pairings which may not be obvious 
                    from their distance on a UMAP visualization (e.g., BET and HDAC inhibitors). With the MOAL R 
                    package, this method can also be used to evaluate the global performance of drug sensitivity 
                    prediction algorithms.
